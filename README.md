# Salp-Swarm-Algorithm-optimization

This is a college project, I used the **Salp Swarm Algorithm** as an optimizer to train a simple artificial neural network (ANN), on the *KDDTrain* dataset.

### Steps:
1. Initialize Population randomly
2. Find the best solution
3. Use Algorithm mathematical equations to update the Population, and explore new search spaces
